# Martian Cargo 
## Overview

The Martian Cargo Finder is a program designed for users to locate their valuable cargo hidden on Earth by Martians. The cargo is equipped with legs (tentacles) and can move if the user enters a kilometer marker without any cargo. The user's task is to input markers until all boxes are found, and the total weight matches the required weight.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Follow the prompts to enter kilometer marks for each box.
3. The program will inform you if the total weight of the found boxes matches the required weight.
4. If not, the boxes will be moved to new locations, and you'll be prompted to try again.
5. Repeat the process until all boxes are correctly identified, and the total weight is 713 kilograms.

## Sample Execution
Welcome to the Martian Cargo Finder!
Help the Martians find their buried cargo.

Enter the kilometer marks for each box:
Box 1: 3
Box 2: 5
Box 3: 2

Oops! The total weight is 10 kg. Try again.

The boxes have moved to new locations. Try again.

Enter the kilometer marks for each box:
Box 1: 7
Box 2: 1
Box 3: 4

Congratulations! You've found all the boxes.
